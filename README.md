## How It's Made

Tech: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, API

I made an API call to the Merriam Webster API to retrieve the definitions. Since the API is quite a dense object, I loaded data into variable and then passed these variables into the DOM. TailwindCSS and DaisyUI were used as styling components

## Optimizations

I stored deeply embedded data in variables for easy access. For future implementations, I plan to include functionality to handle user typos.

## Lessons Learned

Some APIs have a lot of data and it can become cumbersome to search for specifics. Always read API documentation and implement easy to read variables in your code for future readability
